## Messenger Auto Reply Bot For Personal Account

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

I really wanted to have bot for my personal messenger account. But I couldn't find anything
that has been made by other person or even a API from messenger for automating. So I made my BOT 
myself using Python Selenium.

## Features

- Instantly responds to chat that popped in your inbox with any text you want.
